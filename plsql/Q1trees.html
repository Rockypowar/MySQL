    Introduction to plsql
PL/SQL, or Procedural Language/Structured Query Language, is a powerful extension of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for creating stored procedures, functions, triggers, and more within Oracle databases. It combines the flexibility of SQL with the procedural functionality of programming languages like C PL/SQL is a block structured language that enables developers to combine the power of SQL with procedural statements.All the statements of a block are passed to oracle engine all at once which increases processing speed and decreases the traffic.

Basics of PL/SQL
</code>

•PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions to the Structured Query Language (SQL).
PL/SQL is a combination of SQL along with the procedural features of programming languages.
Oracle uses a PL/SQL engine to processes the PL/SQL statements.
PL/SQL includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. It allows
declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variable of those types and triggers.
Disadvantages of SQL:

<code style="font-size: larger;">
SQL doesn’t provide the programmers with a technique of condition checking, looping and branching.
SQL statements are passed to Oracle engine one at a time which increases traffic and decreases speed.
SQL has no facility of error checking during manipulation of data.
Features of PL/SQL:</code>

<code style="font-size: larger;">
PL/SQL is basically a procedural language, which provides the functionality of decision
making, iteration and many more features of procedural programming languages.
PL/SQL can execute a number of queries in one block using single command.
One can create a PL/SQL unit such as procedures, functions, packages, triggers, and types,
which are stored in the database for reuse by applications.
PL/SQL provides a feature to handle the exception which occurs in PL/SQL block known as
exception handling block.
</code>
<code style="font-size: larger;">
Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to computer hardware or operating system where
Oracle is operational.
PL/SQL Offers extensive error checking.
Structure of PL/SQL Block:
PL/SQL extends SQL by adding constructs found in procedural languages, resulting in a
structural language that is more powerful than SQL. The basic unit in PL/SQL is a block.
All PL/SQL programs are made up of blocks, which can be nested within each other.
DECLARE
declaration statements;
BEGIN
executable statements
EXCEPTIONS
exception handling statements
END;
</code>

<code style="font-size: larger;">
Declare section starts with DECLARE keyword in which variables, constants, records as
cursors can be declared which stores data temporarily.
It basically consists definition of PL/SQL identifiers. This part of the code is optional.
Execution section starts with BEGIN and ends with END keyword.
This is a mandatory section and here the program logic is written to perform any task like loops and conditional statements. It supports all DML commands, DDL commands and SQL*PLUS built-in functions as well.
Exception section starts with EXCEPTION keyword.This section is optional which contains statements that are executed when a run-time error occurs. Any exceptions can be handled
in this section.
PL/SQL identifiers
There are several PL/SQL identifiers such as variables, constants, procedures, cursors, triggers etc.
Variables: Like several other programming languages, variables in PL/SQL must be declared prior to its use. They should have a valid name and data type as well. Syntax for
declaration of variables:
variable_name datatype [NOT NULL := value ]; PL/SQL Cursor When an SQL statement is processed, Oracle creates a memory area known as context area. A cursor is a pointer to this context area. It contains all information needed for processing the statement. In PL/SQL, the context area is controlled by Cursor. A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed by it. A cursor is used to referred to a program to fetch and process the rows returned by the SQL statement, one at a time. There are two types of cursors: Implicit Cursors Explicit Cursors
. PL/SQL Implicit Cursors
1 The implicit cursors are automatically generated by Oracle while an SQL statement is executed, if you don't use an explicit cursor for the statement.
These are created by default to process the statements when DML statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc. are executed.
Orcale provides some attributes known as Implicit cursor's attributes to check the status of DML operations. Some of them are: %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, %ROWCOUNT and %ISOPEN.
For example: When you execute the SQL statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE then the cursor attributes tell whether any rows are affected and how many have been affected.
If you run a SELECT INTO statement in PL/SQL block, the implicit cursor attribute can be used to find out whether any row has been returned by the SELECT statement.
It will return an error if there no data is selected.
DECLARE
total_rows number(2);
BEGIN
UPDATE customers
SET salary = salary + 5000;
IF sql%notfound THEN
dbms_output.put_line('no customers updated');
ELSIF sql%found THEN
total_rows := sql%rowcount;
dbms_output.put_line( total_rows || ' customers updated ');
END IF;
END;
/ Output:
6 customers updated
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.
Exeception Handling in Sql
DECLARE
declarations section;
BEGIN
executable command(s);
EXCEPTION
WHEN exception1 THEN
statement1;
WHEN exception2 THEN
statement2;
[WHEN others THEN]
/* default exception handling code */
END;
</code>

<code style="font-size: larger;">
DECLARE
temp varchar(20);
BEGIN
SELECT g_id into temp from geeks where g_name='GeeksforGeeks';
exception
WHEN no_data_found THEN
dbms_output.put_line('ERROR');
dbms_output.put_line('there is no name as');
dbms_output.put_line('GeeksforGeeks in geeks table');
end;
Exception name descriptions
CASE_NOT_FOUND None of the cases in a CASE statement evaluates to "true", and there is no ELSE condition.
CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN An attempt was made to open a cursor that is already open.
DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX There are duplicate values for the index key.
INVALID_CURSOR An attempt was made to access an unopened cursor.
INVALID_NUMBER The numeric value is invalid.
LOGIN_DENIED The user name or password is invalid.
NO_DATA_FOUND No rows satisfied the selection criteria.
NOT_LOGGED_ON A database connection does not exist.
OTHERS For any exception that has not been caught by a prior condition in the exception section.
SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT An array index is out of range or does not exist.
SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT The data type of an array index expression is not assignable to the array index type.
TOO_MANY_ROWS More than one row satisfied the selection criteria, but only one row is allowed to be returned.
VALUE_ERROR The value is invalid.
