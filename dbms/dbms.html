INTRODUCTION OF DBMS (Database Management System)
</code> 
<code style="font-size: larger;">
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to 
create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.

DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve the data in coinvent and efficient manner.

KEY FEATURES OF DBMS
</code>
Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a database.

Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching
 and querying the data.

Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data 
without conflicting 
with each other.

Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data 
and access controls that 
restrict who can access the data.

Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.

DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)

RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data are related to each other through primary and 
foreign keys.

NoSQL: Data is organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance
 scenarios.

A database is a collection of interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes
 the data in the form 
of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. For Example, a university database organizes the data about students, faculty, admin staff, etc. which helps 
in the efficient retrieval,
 insertion, and deletion of data from it.

Advantages of DBMS
</code>
<code style="font-size: larger;">
Data organization: A DBMS allows for the organization and storage of data in a structured manner, making it easy to retrieve and query the data as
 needed.

Data integrity: A DBMS provides mechanisms for enforcing data integrity constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that
 restrict who can access 
the data.

Concurrent access: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without
 conflicting with 
each other.

Data security: A DBMS provides tools for managing the security of the data, such as controlling access to the data and encrypting sensitive data.

Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.

Data sharing: A DBMS allows multiple users to access and share the same data, which can be useful in a collaborative work environment.

Disadvantages of DBMS
</code>
<code style="font-size: larger;">
Complexity: DBMS can be complex to set up and maintain, requiring specialized knowledge and skills.

Performance overhead: The use of a DBMS can add overhead to the performance of an application, especially in cases where high levels of concurrency are 
required.

Scalability: The use of a DBMS can limit the scalability of an application, since it requires the use of locking and other synchronization mechanisms to 
ensure data consistency.

Cost: The cost of purchasing, maintaining and upgrading a DBMS can be high, especially for large or complex systems.

Limited Use Cases: Not all use cases are suitable for a DBMS, some solutions donâ€™t need high reliability, consistency or security and may be better served by
 other types of data
storage.
